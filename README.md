# CMPM 121 D2 Project

About this project:

I did not finish step 12. I could not figure out how to get the color to be saved mark for mark, nor how to rotate stickers. Maybe if the content of the class covered that specific, or if I felt more confident in the ability of the human tutors (I will never use that god-forsaken AI) then I could have potentially succeeded.
